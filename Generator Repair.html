                    <h2>On the Subject of Generator Repair</h2>
                    <p class="flavour-text">Death is not an escape.</p>
                    <h3>The defuser cannot play this module with heartbeat audio pack.</h3>
					<ul>
                        <li>This module consists of a screen in the middle, a start button, a stop button and a progress bar.</li>
                        <li>To solve the module, you must repair a generator by hitting skill checks in a Dead By Daylight trial.</li>
                        <li>To start repairing the module, press the start button. During the process of repairing, skill checks will appear regularly.</li>
                        <li>If you hear heartbeat, this means that you are in the killer's Terror Radius and the killer is close to you.</li>
                        <li>You can press the stop button at anytime to stop repairing, unless you are in the Terror Radius, in such case you must stop repairing within 3 seconds. If you stop while you are in a skill check, you must hit it to stop the repairing process, regardless of you succeeding it or not, otherwise you will get a strike.</li>
                        <li>After stopped repairing, you can press the start button to continue repairing, unless you are in the Terror Radius, in such case you must not repair the generator while you are still in the Terror Radius.</li>
                        <li>Repairing the generator at the wrong time will cause a strike. You will also be hooked by the killer, disabling the module for 30 seconds. The killer will also damage the generator and the generator will regress at a rate of 0.25 charge/s.</li>
                        <li>Hitting the small white area is considered a great skill check, awarding you an extra 2% progression.</li>
                        <li>Failing a skill check will cause the generator to explode, losing 10% of total progress, pausing the progress registration for 3 seconds, increasing the chance of the killer finding you and causing a strike.</li>
                        <li>You will need to repair the generator for 80 charges (80 seconds) provided that no great skill check is hit, nor failing any skill check.</li>
                        <li>The time required and difficulty to repair a generator may be altered by the perk the kilers are using, which is stated below. You may also use your own perks to help you to survive. Before you start repairing, the screen will present you the perks that you and the killer are using, and whether you are the obsession or not.</li>
                        <li>Hearing a scream indicates the status of your teammates. A short scream means that a survivor is put into dying state. A long scream means that a survivor is hooked.</li>

                        * At the start of the bomb, a random module is chosen to be the hex module. This module cannot be a boss module, nor other Generator Repair modules.
                        <br>
                        If the hex module is solved before you start repairing the generator, another random module will be chosen to be the hex module. This means that the hex effect can only be removed during the trial.
                        <br>
                        If all other modules are solved, then the hex effects will always persist, meaning that the hex can no longer be removed.
                        <br>
                        If there are no modules avalible to be the hex module, the killer will not use any hex perks.
